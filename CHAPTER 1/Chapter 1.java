The compilation phases are the Java compiler(JAVAC) and the Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
    The Javac translates the source code into bytecodes that repesents the tasks to execute in the execution phase. While the JVM then executes the bytecode.

OBJECT: it has it's own designs and characteristics, it's a software object meaning it's reusable and it's blueprint can be used to design other watches.
ATTRIBUTES: it has some attributes such as;it has different colours,timer settings,alarm settings, battery life, date and so many more.
BEHAVIOURS: these are the actions performed in the wrist watch just like the methods that can be called on,such as; the time displayed,setting alarms.
CLASS: every wrist watch belongs to a particular a class either the digital, analog, smartwatches etc.
INHERITANCE: this means that you can create wrist watches from other existing ones and you can add different characteristics to them.An alarm clock for example can be
made from a wrist watch blueprint just that we added some specific features to it.
MODELING: this means representing the wrist watch in like a virtual way to show it's features.
MESSAGES: this works together with the method that can be called on,it basically sends to the watch object like; setting the time, alarm.
ENCAPSULATION: this is just the hiding of specific details from other classes or objects that you do not want another class to inherit.like hiding some details of 
the wrist watch so other classes don't inherit it.
INTERFACE: these are sets of instructions or methods  that tells the objects what to do but not how to do it.The user can basically tell the watch what to do but 
they don't know how it does it.
INFORMATION HIDING: same as encapsulation.

To basically know your carbon foot-print, follow the following algorithm in order to test drive;
-check your settings.
-open the website(terrapass or carbon footprint): read everything about it
-fill in the necessary online forms with your personal such as; energy consumption,transportation,diet.
-submit the forms
-and then wait to get the estimate of your carbon footprint. 
-incase you want to calculate yours, you can use the web to research formulas.

To know your body mass, follow the following algorithm in order to test drive;
-check your settings
-open the website that has been provided by the USDHHS to calculate your BMI.
-fill in the following exercise that is going to be provided.
-submit it.
-then wait to get the result of your BMI
-just incase you want to get your BMI by yourself,you can research the formulas from the web.

This is the algorithm to be followed in order to replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral words;
1 Break the algorithm into words using tokenization by the whitespace.
2 Create a dictionary to map the gender-specific words to the gender-neutral replacements, in order to create consistency and make it easier to modify.
3 Go throuch all the items to see if it matches each other in order to be sure.
4 Handle the suffixes corectly in order not to have odd words being generated like 'woper child'
5 Re check in order to be sure and avoid mistakes.
6 Then you can transfer the program or algorithm into a java program and run it.
